The eye!


I wanted to design a sketch using the Perlin noise code.

Using research of both Daniel Schiffman and his videos on you tube's coding transition
I implemented what I had learned and added it to information I had found around google to
create my own version of Perlin noise.

I had created several Perlin noise prototypes as well as homework testing these theories out.

My idea was to use noise and points, ellipse, lines to create a sketch which started as nothing but randomly built up to be an eye!.

I eventually achieved this although wanted more from the idea such as linking the mp3 to the noise in some kind of visual display to the mp3.

there has been allot of trial and error plus many, many hours of research and puzzle solving. Even though I have done JavaScript before P5.js is very different.

originally I couldn't get the audio to work in p5.js so used a audio display with controls through html but really wanted to get the audio to work in p5.js.. I eventually achieved this and very happy.

After getting the Audio to work I went about looking how to add buttons and used some previous experience to CSS code them and add functions to stop one mp3 and play another.

Added a refresh button, noise is crazy and I've not used the conventional method to display it but this was my aim. I tried Beziers and had them working but wanted to make a overall sketch.
the refresh button restarts the sketch with a new noise starting point every time.

I posted my end product on the P5.js group I found on Facebook, said it was my first project but my feedback turned out from others better than expected.

Using RGB set as variables' also made a smooth color change very happy with the end result.

Loops, used 3 loops, 1 for ellipse, line, point. All have different setups and work well together.

I think I covered most of the expected things in the brief. Perlin noise, changes over time, interaction (buttons), organic motion, function, randomness.

It's worth mentioning at the beginning for some strange reason I kept searching for pd5.js on google and getting no results,, dOH!

P5.js & Processing very interesting both very similar minus functions vs void, let vs float.

this is definitely a language I'm interested in learning more.
